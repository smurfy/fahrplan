---

Hi N9 and symbian users, 

Version 2.0.15 is the current latest version available in the Nokia store 
and i'm not longer able to update fahrplan via the store.

Once a newer version is available i will provide here the latest versions 
as direct download and if necessary a documentation how to install them.

    Dear Nokia Developer,

    With the growing business opportunities available on the Asha and
    Windows Phone platforms, we have been reviewing our developer content
    programs to see how we can maximize our support to you, our
    developers. As a result of this review, we have decided to focus our
    support and investment in new content toward Asha and Windows Phone.
    Over the next few months we will be transitioning our active developer
    support away from Symbian and MeeGo.

    If you have Symbian and MeeGo content in the Nokia Store, it will
    continue to be available for download to customers, and you will
    continue to receive download and revenue reports as well as payouts
    for downloaded content. However, starting January 1, 2014, you will no
    longer be able to publish any new content or update existing content
    for Symbian and MeeGo.

    We are very excited about the opportunities available with Asha and
    Windows Phone, and hope that you will bring your talents to these
    platforms. We believe that these changes will help improve our ability
    to support you as you develop fantastic apps for your customers.

    Best regards,

    The Nokia Developer Team
